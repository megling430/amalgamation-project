			<h1>SIGNIFICANCE</h1>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, this place is a slice of wild conveniently located off the suburbian stretch. The backyard habitat is not commonly found in the Grand Valley and reminds me of home in rural Pennsylvania.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my significant other Jess, whose family has owned the property for nearly 50 years, he's enjoyed growing up and living in a quiet tranquil oasis while the town of Grand Junction matured around him.<br> 
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this time, Jess has not been without loss. At a very young age, his father died of illness. In adolescence, he buried his older brother's dogs of old age. Then after building his first company, he parted ways with his best friend and feline confidant, Raesha. He buried her closer to the house where he could still watch over her as she rested.</p>
			<img src="photos/raesha_asian.JPG" width="350px" align="center"><p style="text-align:right"><i>Rigg Household Cats, left to right, Raesha and Asian.<br>credit: Karen Rigg</i></p>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the spring, fall and early winter around the property, deer from the surrounding Bookcliff range migrate into the valley to forge for food to keep them warm in the cold, and have their young until the fawn are ready to travel to higher elevation. Jess's property contains an acre and a half of land for deer to pass and pillage, as well as irrigation lines to drink from in warmer months. It is not uncommon to walk around and find their scat amoungst the wild grass.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided on a concept as an ode to this area which I love to spend time at, and to honor age-old traditions of life and death of the animals who choose to cross among these paths.

			<h1>PLANNING</h1>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal for this project was to actually build a tangible sculpture. In doing so, I needed to consider finding a feasible location, reasonable materials, and an idea worth building upon. </p>

			<h1>PROCESS</h1>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My general plan of attack was to build the body section by section: torso > legs > neck > head. I limited my resources to materials and instruments readily available; Nothing new was to be procured for the completion of the project. I used spare wire wrap found in the garage and wood scraps from pruned or dead trees around the property for majority of the body, using the wire to weave between wood pieces to make the wood conglomerations mallable and secure to hold shape. To give join the legs at the knee-joints, I had used deck screws inserted perpendicular to the joints. Then, the legs were attached to a dry-rotting piece of previously treated wood, which would ultimately give support to the torso to stay in an up-right orientation.
			For additional support, I dug underneath the legs, added water so the legs would settle into mud and dry for stability to hold up the torso. A sturdy branch was able to be wedged into the torso as a cantilever for the neck section to be built around, then additionally the head on top of that.</p>

			<h1>RESULTS</h1>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I felt I completed my intention of an abstract deer. I was definitely not methodical through the process, and even when I was gathering materials I was expressing bias based on my intuition to pick certain sticks and applied that to the assembly also. I just went for it, so to speak, choosing days (based upon the weather) that I was going to have x body-part done, so next time I can put together y body-part and problem-solved as I went. There wasn't necessarily a pattern I was trying to execute, but rather an image in my head that I wanted to make tangible in reality.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some issues I had a long the way included the type of wood I was using. Some sticks were too small against others I had been weaving together and were inclined to fall out. With the legs, the wood used was a poplar, and was very dense making it hard to cut into accurately, or even add screws for the joints of the deer. Then, I had to solve how these instable legs were suppose to hold up the torso and ultimately the rest of the body.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the end of the break week, I focused a little bit less on craftsmanship from frustration and angst of having everything done before the deadline (even as I'm typing this with 50 minutes left before presentations start), and picked my battles carefully. If it was okay enough to stand on it's own, and look close to how I wanted, then I could move on and tackle the next issue.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jess's words of wisdom through this project really helped me become okay with what I had created. He pointed out that in art, nothing's ever really going to be done or perfect from the creator's eye. I also have a programmer's mindset that once I have an idea, I jump into action and make my decisions along the way.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily, the weather has been, and still continues to be awesome, which made it easier to complete the building aspect. I didn't overwork or overlift anything I shouldn't have and didn't hurt myself or my baby. I had enough materials and resources from what was lying around at Jess's house to make everything work out okay. There's always room for improvement and ideas that can make the execution easier, but I can walk away actually happy with my design -- unlike the plaster project!</p>
